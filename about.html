The Tal Chess Club in Chennai was founded in August 1972 by International Master (IM) Manuel Aaron, with backing from the Soviet Union as part of an Indo-Soviet Cultural Exchange Programme. The club was named after Manuel Aaron’s chess hero, Mikhail Tal, the Soviet World Chess Champion of 1960/61.</p>

As a child, Anand honed his skills at the club, often dominating five-minute blitz games. The club also played a role in producing many other prominent Indian chess players and hosted landmark tournaments, such as Asia’s first-ever Women Grandmaster Tournament in 1987.</p>
            <p><b>Club Activities:</b>
Tal Chess Club organized major local and national tournaments and Indo-Soviet Friendship events. It fostered a vibrant chess culture, drawing strong players from across India, and served as a training ground for future champions.</p>
